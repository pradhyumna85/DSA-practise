- Non-circular-doubly/singly-linked-list can be used as Stack as well as Queue:
  - Stacks - LIFO -> push/pop (insert/delete) from index=0 (head), peek->head, len | O(1) Space and Time complexity.
  - Queues - FIFO -> push/insert to index=-1 (after tail -> new tail) and pop/delete from index=0 (head), len | O(1) Space and Time complexity.
- Stacks and Queues data structure classes are created by extending/inheriting the singly linked list data structure class.
- Different types of Linked lists can be used, example of usage in the module files main block.
